I set up an Amazon EC2 instance, configured it to work as my self-hosted Github Actions runner, and installed Nodejs and its required tools to be able to run the application.

That installation can take some time, hence why I went for it first - while it's running, I'm setting up the project's Typescript and ESLint configs to get started.
I'm also adding a couple of husky hooks for smooth installation and, more importantly, having ESLint and Prettier run when committing.

Now, I'm getting the bare-bones of the Express application running. After that, I'm setting up code validations - compiling Typescript and running ESLint - and the application deployment, both via Github Actions.
